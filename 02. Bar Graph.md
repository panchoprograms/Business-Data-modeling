# Goals for Bar Graph
  * Display the expenses per month as a comparative value
  * Choosing the right graph
## Revenue vs. Expenses
As a business owner, the operating costs are the most important and controllable values month over month. They should be stable and easy to identify. Once identified, compare them to the monthly revenue. 

In the visualizations tab, there are multiple bar graphs to choose from.

 For this display, I chose the clustered bar graph because I preferred the side-by-side comparison aspect of the visual. To achieve this, an expense calculation needs to be created. 
* Expenses = sum('Sheet1 (3)'[Expenses])
