#  Goals for the Line Graph
 * Revenue Calculations
 * Create a Comparative Data table for Target Revenue (expected) and Revenue of the Previous Year
 * Choose which comparative category is being displayed

##  Revenue Calculations
  Revenue Column
  * Total Revenue= sum('Table Name'[Revenues])
  * Revenues Previous Year  = CALCULATE([Revenues],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Table Name'[Date].[Date]))
  * Revenue Difference = [Revenues] - [Revenues Previous Year]
  * Revenue Change Percentage= DIVIDE ([Revenue Difference],[Revenues Previous Year])

These calculations are the foundation for a project like this. From here we can define the logic for Target Revenue and the period for the Previous Year. The best way I thought to do so was do so as its own table.

## Comparative Data Table
  Create the table 
  * Comparative Data = UNION(ROW("Comparative Data", "Target") , row("Comparative Data", "Previous Year"))
  
  Create value for each
 * Previous year = 
Var Logic = 
COUNTROWS(DISTINCT(
    FILTER(
        ALLSELECTED('Comparative Data'[Comparative Data]),
        'Comparative Data'[Comparative Data] = "Previous Year"
    )
)) = 1
VAR sol1 = CALCULATE([Revenues], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Table Name'[Date].[Date]))
return
If (Logic,
sol1,
BLANK()
)

 * Target = 
VAR Logic =
    COUNTROWS (
        DISTINCT (
            FILTER (
                ALLSELECTED ( 'Comparative Data'[Comparative Data] ),
                'Comparative Data'[Comparative Data] = "Target"
            )
        )
    ) = 1
VAR sol1 = SUM ( 'Table Name'[Revenues (Target)] )
RETURN
    IF (
        Logic,
        sol1,
        BLANK ()
    )

## Display on Line Graph
In Report View, under the visualization tab is where all the types of visuals lie. Once the Line Graph option is chosen insert the values. 

Y-axis 
* Date (Month, Year)

X-axis 
* Total Revenue
* Previous Year Revenue
* Target Revenue
