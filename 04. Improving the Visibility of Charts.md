# Tips learned to improve chart visibility
There are many customizations to graphs and tables under visualization. The options available depend on the visual selected. Some of those options are:

* Legend
* X-axis
* Y-axis
* Data colors
* Data labels
* Total labels
* Shapes
* Plot area
* Title
* Background
* Lock aspect
* Border
* Shadow
* Tooltip
* Visual header
* Shapes
* Position
* Zoom

This scratches the surfaces of certain graphs because, for example, an X-axis isn't visible for a pie chart. After all, pie charts donâ€™t have an X-axis.
