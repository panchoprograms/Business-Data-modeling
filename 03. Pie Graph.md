# Goals for Pie Graph 
The goal of this chart was to find out the rate of completion per project type. This information will help define a more accurate timeline per quote project type, without delaying the future projects scheduled.
In this table, location is recorded but will be discussed in the later section ()

## Needed Information for Completion 
Only one calculation is needed to give the total amount of projects completed. 
For this, the COUNTROWS is used as such 
  * Completed Projects = COUNTROWS('Location Data')

When the pie graph is selected in the visualizations tab the measurement will be described as this.

(Out of the total completed projects is then divided by the description of each)
