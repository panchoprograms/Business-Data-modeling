# Data-Visualization using PowerBi

Data visualization is becoming a pivotal skill across various sectors, encompassing both IT and non-IT backgrounds. Leveraging data visualizations is instrumental in making informed decisions that have the potential to impact business profitability significantly. This repository delves extensively into a spectrum of visualization techniques, including Line Plots, Bar Plots, and Pie Charts. Additionally, comprehensive discussions cover Cards, Slicers, and ArcGIS, offering a diverse set of tools to visualize complex business problems and delve into the root causes and behavioral analyses of both people and customers associated with them.

My goal with this project was to shift my business perspective using Data Visualizations through Interactive Live Dashboards using PowerBi.

In this tutorial, I have discussed all the important and prominent charts and their variations so that anybody can understand them easily. Ideally, anyone with a small business could create a similar analysis, provided minimal record keeping.

Depending on the business model, sales or services I also explored how to analyze customer location.
